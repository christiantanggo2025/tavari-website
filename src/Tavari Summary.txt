## üß† **Christian's Development Preferences & Working Style**
Based on this development session, here are key insights about how Christian prefers to work and build systems:

### üéØ **Problem-Solving Approach**
- **Persistence with Pragmatism**: Will work through complex problems methodically, but knows when to step back and try a completely different approach
- **"Different Angle" Philosophy**: When something isn't working, prefers to rethink the entire approach rather than keep forcing the same solution
- **Testing-Focused**: Wants to test features immediately as they're built - "done and tested" is the standard
- **Real-World Application**: Every feature must solve an actual business problem (replacing the Raspberry Pi, generating ad revenue, etc.)

### ‚ö° **Speed & Efficiency Preferences**
- **Rapid Iteration**: Built 90% of MVP in under 4 hours - values fast progress over perfect initial implementation
- **Surgical Updates**: Prefers exact file modifications over complete rewrites ("give me real reference lines of code")
- **Step-by-Step Problem Solving**: When errors occur, wants to tackle them one step at a time rather than massive changes
- **Immediate Feedback**: Wants to see results quickly and iterate based on what's working

### üîß **Technical Standards**
- **Business-First Architecture**: Everything must respect multi-tenant business structure from day one
- **Database Integrity**: Proper foreign keys, RLS policies, and data isolation are non-negotiable
- **User Experience Focus**: Features must be intuitive - "if it feels unfinished, it is"
- **Error Handling**: Expects comprehensive error handling and graceful degradation
- **Real-World Reliability**: Systems must work in production environments, not just demos

### üí° **Feature Development Philosophy**
- **MVP + Revenue**: Build core functionality first, but include monetization from the beginning
- **User Control**: Prefers giving users choices (immediate switch vs wait for song, loop vs stop, etc.)
- **Automation + Manual Override**: Likes smart automation that can be overridden when needed
- **Practical Business Value**: Every feature should solve a real business operational need

### üõ† **Working Style Observations**
- **Direct Communication**: Straightforward feedback - "still not working" rather than lengthy explanations
- **Solution-Oriented**: When something breaks, immediately looks for the fix rather than dwelling on the problem
- **Quality Standards**: Won't accept "good enough" - features need to actually work as intended
- **Collaborative Problem-Solving**: Open to trying different approaches when suggested, but maintains clear vision of end goals

### üìã **Preferred Development Flow**
- **Clear Requirements**: Start with specific, actionable goals
- **Incremental Building**: Add one feature at a time, test immediately
- **Real Data Integration**: Use actual database connections, not mock data
- **Error Resolution**: Address issues one at a time with targeted fixes
- **User Testing**: Test from the user's perspective, not just technical functionality
- **Iterate Based on Reality**: Adjust approach based on what actually works in practice

This working style leads to high-quality, production-ready systems built efficiently with strong business focus and user experience standards.
