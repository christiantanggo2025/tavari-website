üß† Tavari Project Summary (Updated)
This project is a secure, scalable internal system built using Supabase and a modular React frontend. It supports authenticated user access, PIN verification, business role management, and secure auditing. The frontend is structured using route protection, context providers, and role-based access logic.

‚úÖ Existing Project Features:
Supabase-managed authentication (email/password)

PIN-based second-layer verification after login

users table with hashed pin values

user_roles table supports:

Multiple roles per user

Business-scoped permissions

Active/inactive flags

Frontend routing using React Router

Global UserContext and RoleContext

Route guards based on session and role

Conditional UI rendering (e.g. hide "Manage Roles" for non-owners)

Full audit logging on login, logout, and dashboard/profile access

Use of bcrypt for secure PIN comparison

Logout flow logs user event and clears session

Reset password via email has been disabled in favor of a custom flow:

User enters email, phone, and pin

If all match, they may reset their password

üÜï Newly Added or Changed (as of July 29, 2025):
üîÅ PIN field is now pin, not pin_code in the users table

‚úÖ Role checking now uses user_roles table via user_id and business_id

‚úÖ UserContext provides current auth user globally

‚úÖ RoleContext provides the active business-scoped role for UI logic

‚ùå email is no longer a reliable lookup key in users due to schema shift ‚Äî logic must now use id (auth UID) for all lookups

üß® Severe issue emerged:

Users are getting locked out on first login attempt

This is unrelated to the PIN flow or localStorage

The current login flow attempts to query users using .eq("email", email), which fails silently and breaks app navigation

‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT PROBLEM (for new chat to solve)
When logging in with correct email and password, users are immediately logged out or stuck in a broken state.
There are no PIN attempts, no localStorage issues ‚Äî it is happening at the email/password login stage.

üõ† What the next chat needs to do:
Review all uploaded files:

Login.jsx

Unlock.jsx

useUserProfile.js

UserContext.jsx

RoleContext.jsx

and anything else already uploaded

Confirm how supabase.auth.signInWithPassword() is handled

Fix the logic that currently tries to query the users table using .eq('email', email) instead of .eq('id', auth_user.id)

Ensure that:

Users with correct credentials successfully sign in

The session is preserved

Their role is loaded correctly from user_roles

Redirect logic works without locking out or failing silently
